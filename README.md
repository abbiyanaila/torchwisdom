This library is built on the top of pytorch as one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. This library got its inspiration from keras, fastai and torchtools. The purpose of this library is to make deep learning engineer or scientist easier to train the neural network. 

Some of the package that is available in this library are:
	* tabular
	* audio
	* text
	* vision

The package of the library represents a toolset to train a kind of data, from tabular, audio, text and vision kind of dataset. This library is still under construction to version 0.1 alpha.
